# fifa-data-cleaning-transformation


This project aims to clean and transform the FIFA dataset using the Python libraries Pandas and NumPy. The FIFA dataset contains information about professional football players such as their club, age, height, weight, nationality, skill ratings, and more.

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Data Cleaning: The dataset may contain missing values, duplicates, or inconsistent data. We will identify and handle these issues to ensure the dataset is clean and usable.

2. Data Transformation: We will transform the dataset to make it more suitable for analysis. This may involve changing data types, creating new variables, or aggregating data to extract useful insights.
